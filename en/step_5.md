## Install the camera

When you're happy with the 3D-printed parts, you can proceed to the hardware installation.

Firstly, lift the two tabs on either side of the High Quality Camera to disconnect the ribbon cable from the camera.

Slip the cable through the slit in the base. Make sure you have the correct orientation so that the blue side will face the bottom of the case when folded as shown below

Then fold the ribbon. These folds allow the camera cable to come up the side of the Raspberry Pi with enough flex to insert into the CSI camera port (see further down).

+ Lay the ribbon out with the writing face up and the visible connectors on the left. At 1cm along the ribbon, fold the ribbon downwards.

+ Now measure 4cm from the top of the ribbon and fold the ribbon to the right.

+ Finally, measuring 4cm from the bottom-left corner, fold the ribbon upwards.

+ Tape the ribbon on the bottom to prevent it from unfurling. We have used Kapton tape, but any kind of tape will work fine.

+ Reconnect the **Cam** end of the ribbon cable to the Camera Module. Make sure that the tin connectors are facing the front and the blue tab is on the back.



+ When you're happy, use the small black M2 cross-head screws to install the Camera Module. The screws will cut their own thread in the support pillar pilot holes, but after a few turns you'll probably need a small screwdriver to continue.

Stop turning as soon as the head of the screw touches the Camera Module; if you tighten the screw too much, it can cause the support pillar to split horizontally along the grain of the print. Furthermore, try to avoid removing and re-threading the screws, as doing so will cut a new thread and, if done repeatedly, will erode the inside of the support pillar so that the screws will not hold.
