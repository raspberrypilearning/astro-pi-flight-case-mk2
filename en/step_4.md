## Remove the scaffolding

In order to keep the model structurally sound while printing, your 3D printer will create what's called scaffolding and rafting to prevent the hot thermoplastics from bending or sagging. Leave the print to cool right down to room temperature before you touch it.



### Flight Unit Base

--- task ---

If you used a raft for the print, you may be able to remove the scaffolding on the heat sink using just your hands; this part may bend slightly, so don't be too rough while you are removing the unwanted material.

### Flight Unit Top

The base scaffolding should come away easily if you remove it it sections. Before you start, carefully use a craft knife or scalpel to split the sides of the fins away from the scaffold.

You can also use a narrow flat screwdriver as aa level to free the scaffold from the case itself. It should require little force and be careful not to snap off any of the fins.

Don't forget to clear the material around the SD card slot; this can be done easily using a small screwdriver.

Once you find that sections of the scaffold have become severed from the rest and the base, carefully slip them off the fins. You can also use a craft knife to cut the scaffolding into sections for easy removal in stages.

### HQC mount

--- task ---
Once again, carefully use a craft knife or scalpel to split the sides of the scaffold filling the recess for the HQC.

A small flat head screwdriver can be used to start to lift one edge of the scaffold

The scaffolding should come away easily if you peel it with your fingers.

## Do a fit check

--- task ---
Before proceeding, put all the pieces together to check that they fit correctly. The lipped edge between the base and top pieces is of most concern to you here. The HQC camera mount needs to fit snugly into the base.

Don't worry about any imperfections or residue from the scaffolding at this stage; you can tidy this up later with sandpaper.
