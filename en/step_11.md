## Connect the buttons to the Raspberry Pi

+ Fit the middle section of the Astro Pi case onto the base. You should do this now, because the GPIO wires will prevent it from being fitted later.

Now you are going to wire the buttons to the free GPIO pins at the bottom of the header.

+ Turn the Astro Pi case so that the Ethernet and USB ports are at the bottom, and the GPIO pins are on the right of the Raspberry Pi.

The pins marked in red are where you will wire up the buttons, with the bottom of the diagram being the pins closest to the USB ports.

+ Look at the **underside** of the lid, with the buttons on the left and the display hole on the right. Connect the coloured wire from each button to the corresponding pin below:

- Top four buttons
    - Top: **GPIO 26**
    - Bottom: **GPIO 13**
    - Left: **GPIO 19**
    - Right: **GPIO 20**
- Bottom pair of buttons
    - Left: **GPIO 21**
    - Right: **GPIO 16**

+ Finally, connect the ground wire to either pin 34 or 39 (labelled **Ground** on the GPIO diagram).

The lid will now be a bit awkward until we finish, but try to position it gently so it is not in the way.

The picture below shows one of the flight units that went into space. On the right, you can see the base of the RTC board with the connector pins for the buttons. If you look at the button contacts on the left, you'll see we used only one black ground wire going from button to button.
