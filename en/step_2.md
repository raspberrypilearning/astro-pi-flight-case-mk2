## Get the 3D files

The 3D files are in [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29){:target="_blank"} format, which is widely used in 3D printing all over the world.  Import using metric millimetres (mm), and no scale adjustments will be required.

Download each of these files and save them to a folder on your computer:

**Part 1 - Flight Unit Top**

* [Heat sink](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/Astro_Pi_Heat_Sink.stl) 


**Part 2 - Flight Unit Base**

* [Base for Model B+ or Model 2](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/Astro_Pi_Base_Pi1_or_2.stl) 

**Part 3 - HQC mount**

* [Middle](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/Astro_Pi_Middle.stl) or [Anti-warp middle](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/anti-warping/Astro_Pi_Middle_warp.stl)

**Part 4 - Light Sensor window**

* [Lid 10mm](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/Astro_Pi_Lid_10mm_Buttons.stl) or [Anti-warp lid 10mm](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/anti-warping/Astro_Pi_Lid_10mm_Buttons_warp.stl) - 10mm holes, for use with the APEM buttons

**Part 5 - Joystick cap**

Note that this joystick cap may need some slight adjustments due to the nozzle size and layer height of your printer. If you have difficulty with fitting it onto the stump of the Sense HAT joystick then try using a layer height of 0.1mm as opposed to 0.15mm.
