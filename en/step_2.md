## Get the 3D files

The 3D files are in [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29){:target="_blank"} format, which is widely used in 3D printing all over the world.  Import using metric millimetres (mm), and no scale adjustments will be required.

If you're looking to reproduce an authentic copy of the Astro Pi Flight Cases, you'll be using one of the Kemet PIR sensors that is included on the ISS devices.

If you're wanting to build a Flight Case for your Astro Pi Mission Space Lab kit, then you may wish to use the modified STL files that have been produced to allow you to easily fit the Parallax PIR  sensor (which is supplied in the kit) to the front panel. 

These means that for the front panel there are 4 different options. make sure you download an print the right one for your project. 

Download each of these files and save them to a folder on your computer:

**Part 1 - Flight Unit front panel**

This is the standard case front panel, like the ones on the ISS. It has a square hole in the top right for the Kemet PIR sensor.

Version 1 :  XX mm button holes, for use with the buttons used on the ISS Flight Units:

* [Front panel - standard version](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/Astro_Pi_Heat_Sink.stl) 

Version 2 :  XX mm button holes:

* [Front panel - standard version](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/Astro_Pi_Heat_Sink.stl) 
  
And this is a modified version that has a slot for mounting the larger PIR that is supplied in the official Astro Pi Mission Space lab entrant kits.

Version 1 :  XX mm button holes, for use with the buttons used on the ISS Flight Units:

* [Front panel - standard version](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/Astro_Pi_Heat_Sink.stl) 

Version 2 :  XX mm button holes:

* [Front panel - standard version](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/Astro_Pi_Heat_Sink.stl) 
  
**Part 2 - Flight Unit Base**

* [Base](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/Astro_Pi_Base_Pi1_or_2.stl) 

**Part 3 - HQC sensor mount**

* [HQC sensor mount](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/Astro_Pi_Middle.stl) 

**Part 4 - Light Sensor window**

* [Light sensor window](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-case/raw/master/data/3d-printed/STL/Astro_Pi_Lid_10mm_Buttons.stl) 

**Part 5 - Joystick cap**

Note that this joystick cap may need some slight adjustments due to the nozzle size and layer height of your printer. If you have difficulty with fitting it onto the stump of the Sense HAT joystick then try using a layer height of 0.1mm as opposed to 0.15mm.
