## Install the Raspberry Pi

+ Firstly, ensure there's no residual scaffolding material around the SD card slot or LED holes that might prevent the Raspberry Pi from lining up with the mounting pillars.

+ Once you're happy, line the Raspberry Pi up and do a fit check. Verify that it doesn't touch the Camera Module below it. Don't insert the camera ribbon cable just yet, as this will make the next job awkward.

+ Next, screw the M2.5 11mm stand-offs into each corner of the Pi. With some light finger pressure they will cut their own thread in the support pillar pilot holes. After a few turns you'll need to use a small pair of pliers to continue turning them. Try to get the stand-offs to go into the support pillars straight down, and not at a slight angle, because that can lead to alignment issues with the Sense HAT later on. Be careful while you do this and, again, stop turning as soon as the stand-off touches the Raspberry Pi to avoid splitting the pillars horizontally along the grain of the print.

If you are having trouble screwing in the stand-offs, screw one of the silver M2.5 cross-head screws into the stand-off, then use the screw head to screw the stand-off into the case. Once the stand-off is in place, don't forget to remove the screw.

+ You can now insert the camera ribbon cable into the CSI port of the Raspberry Pi. Try to make sure the tin connectors are all level to ensure a good connection.
