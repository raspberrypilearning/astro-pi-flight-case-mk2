Your Astro Pi is almost complete — the last thing to do is install your 3D-printed joystick cap by pressing it onto the Sense HAT joystick. You will probably need to use glue to keep it in place, but only apply the glue once you've tested everything and are happy that it all works. The Astro Pis on the ISS use a 3D printed cap too!
