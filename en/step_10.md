## Connect wires to the button terminals

First, you will connect your ground loop to the buttons.

+ Starting with the top button, take the crimped wire end furthest from the black plastic jumper lead. Slide the insulation boot down, hold the crimp between finger and thumb and push it all the way onto the button terminal. Once the crimp is firmly in place, slide the insulation boot back up.

+ Repeat to attach one of the black ground wire connections to each of the six buttons.

+ Now take the coloured wires you made earlier and connect one crimped end to the spare terminal of each button, using exactly the same method.
