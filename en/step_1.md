## Introduction

The Astro Pi Flight Unit is one of the most sought-after cases in the history of the Raspberry Pi. The original Mark I hardware Flight Units have been in operation on the ISS since 2015. In 2021, new, upgraded Astro Pis were sent as replacements. With the inclusion of new sensors and the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera, a new Flight Unit design was required. 

In this resource, you will learn how to 3D print your own Astro Pi Mark II Flight Unit case and install the Astro Pi hardware inside it. You’ll then have your very own Astro Pi flight unit, identical in almost every way to the new ones which will soon be operational on the International Space Station right.

You don't have to follow every step exactly as it is described in this guide, and you should think about ways to customsie your flight unit. There are often many different ways to tackle projects like this, so if you have a different preferred technique,  or think that something should be done in a different, you should go ahead and try an alternative approach. This is particularly true for the 3D printing part of the project: there are lots of different 3D printers and filaments and you should expect to have to modify some of the steps in order to take these differences into account.

### Hardware

+ [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and SD card
+ [Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/) 
+ [Raspberry Pi Sense HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/sense-hat/)
+ 2 push buttons (either 10 mm diameter thread or 7 mm - see below)
+ [Kemet](https://uk.farnell.com/kemet/ss-430l-w/pir-sensor-5m-37deg-28deg-5-5vdc/dp/3027688) or [Parallax](https://www.parallax.com/product/pir-sensor-with-led-signal/) PIR (as supplied in official Mission Space lab kits)
+ If using the Kemet PIR, you'll also need the [right cable](https://www.digikey.co.uk/en/products/detail/jst-sales-america-inc/A05SR05SR30K152B/6708507)
+ If using the Parallax PIR, you'll need a 3 segment electrical connector block.
+ M2.5/M2.5 X 11mm X 5mm Male/Female Threaded Hexagon Spacers - Nickel Plated Brass
+ M2.5/M2.5 X 10mm X 5mm Male/Female Threaded Hexagon Spacers - Nickel Plated Brass
+ [26 pin tall header](https://thepihut.com/products/stacking-header-for-raspberry-pi-2x13-extra-tall)
+ M2.5 X 6mm Full Thread Cap Head Screws (DIN 912) - A2 Stainless Steel
+ M4 X 12mm Full Thread Cap Head Screws (DIN 912) - A2 Stainless Steel.
+ M2 X 8mm Full Thread Cap Head Screws (DIN 912) - A4 Stainless Steel
+ 7 short (approx 120mm) jumper wires, one end female.
+ Some 2mm diameter heatshrink tubing
+ a 90 x 50 mm strip of [Rosco 98 medium grey filter film](https://us.rosco.com/en/products/filters/r98-medium-grey) 

If you want to buy the [exact buttons](https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/2/26/pusbutton-switches-serie-10400-1519227.pdf) used in the Astro Pi flight unit, the details are below. they are expensive — that's because they're designed to survive an enormous number of clicks before wearing out, a feature which is necessary for a five-year space mission.

- Manufacturer: APEM
- Manufacturer Part No: 104350003

If you want to use different (cheaper) buttons, then go ahead. We have two different versions of the top panel of the flight unit, one for 10mm buttons, one for 7mm. You should decide on your choice of buttons before printing your case!

### Additional requirements

+ Access to a 3D printer. Many schools now have their own or you might be able to find one at your local [Makerspace](http://www.hackspace.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}. You can also find local 3D printing services through the [3D Hubs website](https://www.3dhubs.com/){:target="_blank"}.

You’re also going to need the following tools:

+ 1.5mm allen key
+ XX allen key
+ Small pair of pliers
+ Craft knife or scalpel
+ Sandpaper
+ Tape
+ Wire strippers
+ Wire cutters
+ Soldering iron and solder. If you've never soldered before, have a look at [this video](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/getting-started-soldering/) for some tips. 
+ Hot air gun

### Software

+ Raspberry Pi OS
